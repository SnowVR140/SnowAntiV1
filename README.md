HOW TO USE

Import the Unity package by either dragging it in or right-clicking and selecting Import Package > Custom Package. Once you have imported that, navigate to Tools > SnowAntiV1. For directories, it is recommended to include the following three:
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.YOURSTUDIONAMEHERE.YOURGAMENAMEHERE/files/Mods
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.YOURSTUDIONAMEHERE.YOURGAMENAMEHERE/files/melonloader
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.YOURSTUDIONAMEHERE.YOURGAMENAMEHERE/files/lemonloader

For DLL/Assemblies, it is recommended to include the following three:
MelonLoader.dll
LemonLoader.dll
BepInEx.dll

For monitored objects, include anything that you want to ensure is not disabled or deleted (make sure that you enter the exact name of the object).

Once you have completed these steps, you can proceed to the next part.

Create an empty GameObject and name it as desired, ensuring it does not appear obvious that it is an AntiCheat. Click on "Add Component" and search for SnowAntiRuntime. For Objects To Monitor, enter the same names as you did in the previous tab.

While this AntiCheat does not guarantee the complete elimination of modders, it should provide some assistance. Ensure to check for updates to receive the latest modder protection!
