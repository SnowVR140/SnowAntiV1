HOW TO USE

Import the Unity package by either dragging it in or right clicking and selecting Import Package > Custom Package
Once you've imported that, go to Tools > SnowAntiV1
For directories, I recommend putting these 3:
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.YOURSTUDIONAMEHERE.YOURGAMENAMEHERE/files/Mods
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.YOURSTUDIONAMEHERE.YOURGAMENAMEHERE/files/melonloader
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.YOURSTUDIONAMEHERE.YOURGAMENAMEHERE/files/lemonloader
For DLL/Assemblies, I recommend putting these 3:
MelonLoader.dll
LemonLoader.dll
BepInEx.dll
For monitered objects, just put anything that you want to make sure isn't disabled/deleted (MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE EXACT NAME OF THE OBJECT IN)

Once you've done all that, you can move onto the next part

Create an empty gameobject, call it whatever, don't make it obvious it's an AntiCheat though
Click add component and search SnowAntiRuntime
For Objects To Monitor, just put the same thing as you did in the tab

Of course this AntiCheat isn't 100% guaranteed to get rid of modders, but it should help
Make sure to check for updates to get the latest modder protection!
